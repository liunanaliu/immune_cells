a markedly altered neutrophil chemotaxis, with funcional and chaemokine receptor expressions, oxidative burst,
and lactoferrin content and an increased number of circulating immature granulocytes, which were associated 
with an increased risk of death after septic shock.
in contrast, phagocytosis and activation capacities were conserved.

for materials and methods,
innclude phenotypic study, activation capacity study with IL8, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
oxidative burst. 

for results, with similar expressio changes for cxcr2 with flow.
