We calculate now GSV A enrichment scores for these gene sets using first the microarray data and then the RNA-seq integer count data. 
Note that the only requirement to do the latter is to set the argument kcdf=“Poisson” which is “Gaussian” by default. 
Note, however, that if our RNA-seq derived expression levels would be continous, such as log-CPMs, log-RPKMs or log-TPMs, 
the the default value of the kcdf argument should remain unchanged.
